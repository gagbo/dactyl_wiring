#+TITLE: Wiring plan for a Dactyl\

* Disclaimer

I am a noob, please don't use this if you don't want to spend a lot of time
double checking what I do.

* Schmatics

I am preparing schematics to prepare a breadboard test of the hand wiring I
plan to do to build a [[https://github.com/gagbo/dactyl-keyboard][Dactyl Manuform]]

* Size

I built a stl from the Clojure enabled OpenSCAD from
[[https://github.com/gagbo/dactyl-keyboard][Matt Adereth]], with `6` rows and
`6 columns`. I want a pretty big ortholinear ergonomic keyboard I can leave
at home with all functions keys and modifiers I may wish (even I don't use
them eventually).

Note that it doesn't change much wiring- and fireware-wise, since additional
columns / rows from the matrix can just be ignored / no-oped.

* Row vs Column driven

In the current version (1307f6e), the current flows from the column line to
the row line because of the diod placement. So this is probably column driven
?
